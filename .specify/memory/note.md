# New Layout Style: cherry_picker

I want to add a new layout style to this application. The name of this new layout will be "cherry_picker". Given a gallery it will display a maxium of 15 images chosed randomly, where at least 7 will be vertical, and 7 will be horizontal. The presentation will be strongly inspired by the @docs/layout-masonry.md.
